# 🎯 ExamWatch: Cheating Detection using YOLO11m Pose Estimation

**ExamWatch** is an AI-powered system that detects suspicious student behavior such as **looking sideways or potential cheating** during classroom or online examinations.
Using **YOLO11m Pose Estimation**, it tracks **head pose angles (yaw and pitch)** to distinguish between **focused** and **suspicious sideways glances**, ensuring exam integrity through **computer vision** and **deep learning**.

---

## 🧠 Features

* 🎥 Real-time detection of **student head movement and posture**
* 🧍 Tracks **yaw (left–right)** and **pitch (up–down)** angles
* 🕵️ Detects **focused** and **suspicious** head orientations
* 📊 Produces **annotated video output** with visual alerts
* ⚡ Built with **YOLO11m Pose**, **OpenCV**, and **cvzone**

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The **YOLO11m Pose model** detects students and extracts body keypoints (nose, eyes, shoulders).
2. The system calculates **yaw** (left–right) and **pitch** (up–down) angles for each detected student.
3. Based on these angles, it classifies head movement as:

| Classification      | Behavior                                          | Indicator |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 🟢 Focused          | Head facing forward/downward (normal behavior)    | ✅ Green   |
| 🔴 Looking Sideways | Head turned beyond threshold (potential cheating) | ⚠️ Red    |

🎥 The annotated video output displays detections in **real-time**.

## 🖼️ Example Output

| Focused | Looking Sideways |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| ✅ Green | ⚠️ Red           |
